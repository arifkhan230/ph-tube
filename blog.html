                <p>Answer: The scope of var variable is functional scope. We can update or re-declared into the scope.
                    <br>
                    The scope of var is block scope. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. <br>
                    The Scope of const is also block scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl pb-2">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
                <p> Ans: Null and undefined are two special values in JavaScript, and they are often used in different
                    contexts for specific purposes. Here are common use cases for null and undefined: <br>
                    undefined: <br>
                    
                    When you declare a variable but don't assign a value to it, it is initialized to undefined.
                    If a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters are assigned the value undefined.
                    Missing Object Properties: If you try to access a property that doesn't exist in an object, it returns undefined. <br>

                    Null: <br>
                    Null is often used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or to represent an empty state. <br>
                    You can set a variable to null to clear out its value or reset it to a known empty state. <br>
                    Null is sometimes used to check if an object or reference exists or not.

                <p>
                    Ans: REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST is not a protocol but rather a set of constraints and principles for creating web services that use HTTP as the communication protocol. <br>
                    In a RESTful API, resources are the central abstractions. Resources can represent objects, data, or services, and they are typically identified by URLs . <br>
                    REST APIs are widely used in web and mobile applications for their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the HTTP protocol. They are a popular choice for building web services that can be easily consumed by a variety of clients.
